# My Portfolio

This is just my portfolio's repo for [my personal webpage](http://lubien.info).

At first, it was just a [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) challenge, but since I wanted to change my portfolio design I did the best of both worlds.

## Usage

I don't know why, but if you want this code, clone this repo.

Make sure you have NodeJS, `npm` and `gulp` installed globally then run `npm install`.
